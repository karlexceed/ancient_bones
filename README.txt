ancient_bones
=====
Adds randomly generated bones with some "loot" to generated dungeons.
Only works if dungeons are actually enabled in mapgen flags.

Based on the vanilla minetest game's dungeon_loot mod, with the bones textures
from the bones mod.
The pool of possible loot has more tools than the normal chests.
